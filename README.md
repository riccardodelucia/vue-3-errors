# Vue Errors

This project starts from the standard Vue template generated by **Vite**, and add a bunch of logic to throw errors within a component.

The purpose is therefore to understand how error flows within a Vue app.
Take inspiration from this code to create a centralized error handling mechanism, by propagating errors from child components up to the root component, where a global error handler is registered, following a similar approach to error handling in Node.js **express.js** framework.
